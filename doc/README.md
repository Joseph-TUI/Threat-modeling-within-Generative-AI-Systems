# STRIDE Approach towards Generative AI

We have designed a Threat Modeling template specifically tailored for Generative AI Systems. Developers and architects can readily apply this template to their application structures. The repository is established in accordance with the research paper titled "Developing a practical approach to threat modeling within Generative AI Systems," present at the International Conference on Advanced Computing, Communication, and Electrical Systems (ICACCES) in 2024.

Are there measures in place to verify the authenticity of the training data and ensure it is not manipulated by malicious entities?. |How to ensure the authenticity of the training data sources to prevent malicious spoofing attempts?.  Are there measures in place to verify and authenticate the origin of the training data? .| How to authenticate and ensure the legitimacy of the output generated by the Generative AI model to prevent spoofing attempts? Are there measures in place to detect and counteract outputs that impersonate legitimate information? .|
| [Model Tampering]	| An e-commerce recommendation system may be vulnerable to model poisoning, where malicious users provide false feedback to manipulate future recommendations.|Evaluate the susceptibility of the model to poisoning attacks and the potential impact on user experience and business integrity. Consider the likelihood of malicious actors attempting such attacks .|
| [Output Manipulation]	| If an AI system controlling critical infrastructure is not properly secured, it could be susceptible to hacking, leading to physical harm or disruption.|Assess the security measures in place, such as access controls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Calculate risk based on the potential consequences of unauthorized access or manipulation.|
